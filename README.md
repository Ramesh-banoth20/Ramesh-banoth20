# 💫 About Me:
I am a motivated third-year B.Tech Computer Science (AI/ML) student with a strong academic foundation and a proven ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems. I began my academic journey with a Diploma in Computer Science, graduating with a CGPA of 9.55, reflecting my consistency, discipline, and technical aptitude. I am currently pursuing my B.Tech at Gokaraju Rangaraju Institute of Engineering and Technology, Hyderabad.<br><br>I have a solid understanding of core computer science subjects, including Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and Database Management Systems. I am proficient in Java, JavaScript, Python, and SQL, with hands-on experience in developing RESTful APIs, handling HTTP requests, and building scalable backend services.<br><br>I have worked on impactful projects such as a Facial Emotion Recognition System, where I applied machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze facial expressions and classify emotions, and a Restaurant Table Reservation System, which involved designing a full-stack solution for managing reservations, user interactions, and backend database operations. These projects enhanced my problem-solving skills and strengthened my understanding of real-world application development.<br><br>Through industry-recognized virtual simulations with JPMorgan Chase, AWS, and Tata Group, I gained exposure to real-world software engineering and data analytics practices. These experiences strengthened my skills in backend architecture, cloud-based system design, event-driven systems using Apache Kafka, and ethical AI-driven predictive modeling.<br><br>I am an active problem solver, having solved over 500 algorithmic problems across platforms such as LeetCode, CodeChef, and Codeforces. I consistently focus on writing clean, efficient, and scalable code with careful attention to time and space complexity. I am eager to grow as a software engineer and researcher by contributing to impactful projects, learning from experienced professionals, and thriving in collaborative, high-performance environments.
